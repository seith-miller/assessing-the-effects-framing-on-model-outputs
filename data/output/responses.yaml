  response: 'The ice cream costs $0.05.


    Let''s denote the cost of the ice cream as x. Since the cake costs $1 more than
    the ice cream, the cost of the cake can be represented as x + $1.


    According to the given information, the total cost of cake and ice cream is $1.10.
    Therefore, we can form the following equation:

    x + (x + $1) = $1.10

    2x + $1 = $1.10

    2x = $0.10

    x = $0.05


    So, the ice cream costs $0.05.'
  response_correct: 'True'
Logic_1_Unframed:
  response: 'Let''s say the cost of the ice cream is x.


    Then, the cost of the cake is x + $1.


    Together, the total cost is x + x + $1 = $1.10.


    This simplifies to 2x + $1 = $1.10.


    Subtracting $1 from both sides, we get 2x = $0.10.


    Dividing by 2, we find that x = $0.05.


    Therefore, the ice cream costs $0.05.'

  response: 'Proposition 1: False

    Proposition 2: True

    Proposition 3: False


    Explanation:

    If Proposition 1 were true, then Proposition 2 would also have to be true. However,
    if Proposition 2 were true, then Proposition 1 would have to be false. This creates
    a contradiction, so Proposition 1 cannot be true.

    If Proposition 2 is true, and Proposition 1 is false, then Proposition 3 must
    also be false. This is because Proposition 3 states that the answers to Propositions
    1 & 2 are the same, but since Proposition 1 is false and Proposition 2 is true,
    the answers are not the same.'
