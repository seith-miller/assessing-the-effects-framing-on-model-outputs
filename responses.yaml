  response: 'The ice cream costs $0.05.


    Let''s denote the cost of the ice cream as x. Since the cake costs $1 more than
    the ice cream, the cost of the cake can be represented as x + $1.


    According to the given information, the total cost of cake and ice cream is $1.10.
    Therefore, we can write the equation:


    x + (x + $1) = $1.10


    By solving the equation, we find:


    2x + $1 = $1.10

    2x = $0.10

    x = $0.05


    So, the ice cream costs $0.05.'

    Proposition 2: True

    Explanation:


    If Proposition 1 is true, then Proposition 2 must also be true according to Proposition
    2. However, this would lead to a contradiction since Proposition 2 states that
    Proposition 1 is true. Therefore, Proposition 1 cannot be true.


    Since Proposition 1 is false, Proposition 2 must be true according to Proposition
    2. Additionally, since Proposition 3 states that the answers to Propositions 1
    & 2 are the same, and Proposition 1 is false and Proposition 2 is true, then Proposition
    3 must be false.

    600 pages, and since the book with 500 pages falls within this page range, it
