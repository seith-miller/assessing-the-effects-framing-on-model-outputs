  response: 'The ice cream costs $0.05.


    Let''s denote the cost of the ice cream as x. According to the information given
    in the question, the cake costs $1 more than the ice cream. Therefore, the cake
    costs x + $1.


    The total cost of the cake and ice cream is $1.10. So, we can set up the equation:


    x + (x + $1) = $1.10


    By solving this equation, we find:


    2x + $1 = $1.10

    2x = $0.10

    x = $0.05

    To prove this, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first

    In this case, n = 10, so the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers

    Based on the given information, we can create a right triangle where:

    - The height of the tower is the opposite side (324 meters)

    - The distance from the base of the tower to your position is the adjacent side
    (54 meters)


    Using the tangent function, we have:


    tan(θ) = Opposite/Adjacent

    tan(θ) = 324/54

    tan(θ) = 6


    Now, we need to find the angle θ such that its tangent is 6. This can be done
    using the inverse tangent function. Therefore:


    θ = arctan(6)

    We can use the tangent function:

    tan(x) = 324 / 54

    To find x, we take the arctan of both sides:
